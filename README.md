# Crop-Yield-Prediction-
Analyzed agricultural data related to different crops, seasons, states, and years. By  cleaning and preparing the data in Excel, querying it using SQL, visualizing patterns with Power BI, and  building predictive models using Python and Machine Learning, we aim to extract valuable insights and  predict crop yields for upcoming years (2025 to 2030)
